# Phase 2: Code Cleanup & Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the changes made during Phase 2 of the Next.js refactoring project.

## P2.2 Remove unused imports, variables, functions, components, and files
- Fixed the ESLint setup to use the new flat config format and resolved circular dependency issues.
- Installed necessary ESLint plugins to improve code quality.
- Fixed all linting errors, which included removing unused imports and variables.
- Used `ts-prune` to identify and remove unused exports.

## P2.3 Consolidate duplicated logic into utilities/hooks
- Installed `jscpd` to detect duplicated code.
- Refactored duplicated code in `placeholder-image.tsx` and `smart-image.tsx` by creating a base interface `BaseImageProps`.
- Refactored duplicated code in `featured-products-skeleton.tsx` by using the `ProductCardSkeleton` component.
- Refactored duplicated code in `hero.tsx` by extracting the `SocialProofItem` component.
- Refactored duplicated code in `hero-block.tsx` and `hero-with-reviews.tsx` by extracting the `Reviews` component.

## P2.4 Simplify overly complex components
- Refactored the `content-block.tsx` component by extracting the `TableOfContents` and `ContentSections` components to improve reusability and reduce complexity.

## P2.5 Validate with type checks and smoke build
- The project is building successfully without any warnings.
- Type checks are passing.

## Risks and Follow-ups
- The `jscpd` tool reported some potential false positives for duplicated code in the skeleton components. These should be investigated further.
- The `content-block.tsx` component still has hardcoded content. This should be moved to a separate data file or passed as props to make the component more reusable.
