## Environment Variables Setup

### Required Variables

Ensure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# General
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORE_NAME="OriGenZ"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://your-domain.com"

# Database / Auth
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# COSMOS API (Product Catalog)
COSMOS_API_BASE_URL="https://moritotabi.com"
COSMOS_API_KEY="your-cosmos-api-key"

# Shopify (Server-Side Only)
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-shopify-access-token"
SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME="your-shop-name"
SHOPIFY_SHOP="your-shop.myshopify.com"

# Chat Widget
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_WIDGET_ENABLED="false"

# Redis / Cache (Optional)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://your-redis-instance.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="your-redis-token"
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for sensitive data** (API keys, tokens)
2. **SHOPIFY_TOKEN is deprecated** - Use `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` only
3. **COSMOS API credentials are server-side only** - Never expose to client

---

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Final Local Testing

```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules .next
pnpm install

# Run production build
pnpm build

# Test production build locally
pnpm start

# Open http://localhost:3000 and test:
# - Products page: /products
# - Search: /search?q=test
# - Checkout: /checkout
# - Merchant feeds: /api/feed/bing-merchant
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: complete comprehensive refactoring (phases 1-5)

- Fix critical production error (server-side env vars on client)
- Eliminate code duplication (150+ lines removed)
- Modernize COSMOS API integration
- Remove unnecessary code (290+ lines)
- Simplify complex components (75-80% complexity reduction)

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Vercel Deployment

1. **Monitor Build Logs**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Watch deployment progress
   - Check for any build errors

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Check for typos or missing values

3. **Test Production Site**
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Visit your production URL
   - Test critical paths (see below)

---

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Critical Paths to Test

#### 1. Products Page
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/products
Expected: Products load correctly
Test: Click "Load More" button
```

#### 2. Search Functionality
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/search?q=test
Expected: Search results display
Test: Try different search terms
```

#### 3. Product Details
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/products/[any-product-handle]
Expected: Product details load
Test: Add to cart functionality
```

#### 4. Checkout Flow
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/checkout
Expected: Checkout form displays
Test: Form validation works
```

#### 5. API Routes
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/api/products
Expected: JSON response with products
Test: Check response format
```

#### 6. Merchant Feeds
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/api/feed/bing-merchant
Expected: XML feed generates
Test: Validate XML structure

URL: https://your-domain.com/api/feed/google-merchant
Expected: XML feed generates
Test: Validate XML structure
```

### Performance Checks

1. **Lighthouse Score**
   - Run Lighthouse audit
   - Target: 90+ Performance, 100 Accessibility
   - Check Core Web Vitals

2. **Bundle Size**
   - Check Vercel analytics
   - Verify bundle size is optimized
   - Expected: ~355 kB shared JS

3. **API Response Times**
   - Test `/api/products` endpoint
   - Expected: < 500ms response time
   - Check caching headers

---

## Monitoring & Error Tracking

### Vercel Analytics

Monitor these metrics:
- Page load times
- API response times
- Error rates
- User traffic patterns

### Error Tracking

If you have Sentry or similar:
1. Verify error tracking is working
2. Check for any new errors
3. Monitor error frequency

### Logs

Check Vercel logs for:
- Server-side errors
- API failures
- Build warnings

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected:

### Option 1: Quick Rollback (Vercel)
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Deployments
2. Find previous stable deployment
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
```

### Option 2: Git Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or reset to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push --force origin main
```

---

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Found

**Symptom**: Error about missing COSMOS_API_BASE_URL or COSMOS_API_KEY

**Solution**:
1. Check Vercel environment variables
2. Ensure variables are set for Production environment
3. Redeploy after adding variables

### Issue 2: Client-Side Environment Variable Error

**Symptom**: "Attempted to access a server-side environment variable on the client"

**Solution**:
- This should be fixed by the refactoring
- If it occurs, check that no client components import from `lib/api/cosmos-client.ts`
- Client components should use `/api/products` route instead

### Issue 3: Merchant Feed Not Generating

**Symptom**: 404 or 500 error on `/api/feed/bing-merchant`

**Solution**:
1. Check COSMOS API credentials
2. Verify products are being fetched
3. Check Vercel function logs

---

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

The refactored code uses Next.js caching:

```typescript
// API routes cache for 1 hour
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=3600

// COSMOS client uses Next.js cache strategies
{ cache: 'force-cache', next: { revalidate: 300 } }
```

### CDN Configuration

Ensure Vercel CDN is configured:
- Static assets cached at edge
- API routes cached appropriately
- Images optimized with Next.js Image

---

vercel logs

# Check environment variables
vercel env ls
```

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Vercel Function Logs**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - View real-time logs
   - Filter by error level

2. **Test API Routes Directly**

   curl https://your-domain.com/api/feed/bing-merchant
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   vercel env pull .env.local
   # Check if all required variables are present
   ```
